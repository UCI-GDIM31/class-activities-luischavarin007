After waiting the class period for GitHub to download, waiting an extra hour for Unity Hub to download, and experiencing a wifi crash, I finally managed to open up the in class activity. I'm not sure if the cat is meant to be moveable at this point; regardless I can't control it. Luckily it seems that Unity uses the same coding software that I have passing familiarity of, that being Visual Studio Code. I can only just barely understand what the code on the Unity Engine signifies, but I suppose that's better than nothing.
